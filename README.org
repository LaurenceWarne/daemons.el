* Services Mode

This is an Emacs mode to give you a UI for managing init system services.

** Init system support

Only =systemd= right now, but it's designed to be extensible. InitV is next on the list.

** Usage

You can open the services dashboard with =M-x services=.

Navigate the services list with =n= and =p=. Refresh the list with =g=.

The following commands are available for each service:

| Key | Command             |
|-----+---------------------|
| RET | Show service status |
| s   | Start service       |
| S   | Stop service        |
| r   | Reload service      |
| R   | Restart service     |

** Installation

Currently just =(load-file "/path/to/services.el")=.
